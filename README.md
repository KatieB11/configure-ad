<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

# Step 1- Set Up Resources in Azure</h1>

## Create the Domain Controller VM</h2>

- Name it "DC-1" and use Windows Server 2022.
- Remember the Resource Group and Virtual Network (Vnet) created during this step.

## Set Static IP for Domain Controller

- Make sure DC-1's NIC Private IP address is set to static.

## Create the Client VM

- Name it "Client-1" and use the same Resource Group and Vnet from Step 1.

## Ensure Both VMs are in the Same Vnet

- You can verify this using Network Watcher.

-----

# Step 2- Ensure Connectivity

## Check Connection

- Log in to "Client-1" with Remote Desktop.

- Ping "DC-1" in Powershell by typing in ping -t 'ip address' (make sure you use these - <> before placing word of 'ip address'). Make sure to replace 'ip address' with DC-1's private IP to confirm a successful connection.

## Enable ICMPv4

- On "DC-1," enable ICMPv4 in the Windows Firewall.

## Verify Ping

- Check back on "Client-1" to confirm that the ping to DC-1 succeeds.

-----

# Step 3- Install Active Directory

## Install Active Directory

- Log in to "DC-1" and install Active Directory Domain Services.

## Promote as a Domain Controller

- Set up a new forest (e.g., mydomain.com).

- After installation, restart DC-1.

## Log Back In

- Log back into DC-1 as user "mydomain.com\labuser."

-----

# Step 4- Create Admin and Normal User Accounts

## Create Organizational Units (OUs)

- In Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC), create an OU called "_EMPLOYEES."

- Create another OU named "_ADMINS."

## Create Admin User

- Create a new employee named "Jane Doe" with the username "jane_admin."

- Add "jane_admin" to the "Domain Admins" Security Group.

## Switch to Admin Account

- Log out/close the Remote Desktop connection to DC-1.

- Log back in as "mydomain.com\jane_admin."

- Use "jane_admin" as your admin account from now on.

-----

# Step 5- Join Client-1 to Your Domain

## Update DNS Settings

- In the Azure Portal, set Client-1's DNS settings to the DC's Private IP address.

## Restart Client-1

- Restart Client-1 from the Azure Portal.

## Join Client-1 to Domain

- Log in to Client-1 (Remote Desktop) as the original local admin (labuser).

- Join it to the domain (Client-1 will restart).

## Verify in ADUC

- Log in to the Domain Controller (Remote Desktop).

- Confirm that Client-1 shows up in Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) inside the "Computers" container on the root of the domain.

-----

# Step 6- Set Up Remote Desktop for Non-Admin Users on Client-1

## Log into Client-1 as jane_admin

- Open system properties.

- Click "Remote Desktop."

- Allow "domain users" access to remote desktop.

## Non-Admin Access

- You can now log into Client-1 as a normal, non-administrative user.

# Step 7- Create Additional Users and Test

## Create Additional Users

- Log in to DC-1 as jane_admin.

- Open PowerShell_ise as an administrator.

- Copy and run the script from this [link](https://github.com/anumkhanit/AD_Users/blob/main/Generate-Names-Create-Users.ps1).

- Observe the accounts being created in the appropriate OU.

## Test Additional User Logins

- Attempt to log into Client-1 with one of the newly created accounts (note the password from the script).

-----

# Conclusion
You've successfully set up Active Directory in Azure and created user accounts for your domain. You can now manage your domain and user access efficiently. Now that your directory is in place, explore how to manage groups and permissions to further control user access.
